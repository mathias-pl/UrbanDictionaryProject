# UrbanDictionaryProject

This app will let you learn some new words coming from the Urban Dictionary! It can also shows some cool stats about a bunch of things :)

The main.py file is just a playground to test the logic of the codde before implementing it into the real GUI app!
  It was the main project at the beginning. Maybe the name's gonna change 'til the end
  Should make a while loop that will give the opportunity to redo some operations instead of restarting the program each time

The gui.py file is the real app, the one that should be interacted with. I'm still learning to use Git and tkinter so be patient...
  It still have some comments that are old code. Bad habit!
  
The functions.py file contains all the functionalities on what the gui.py should work.
  1-Search : Search a word in the database of the Urban Dictionary
    -Have some bugs and show something data that seems messy
  2-Learn : Shows a random word and his definition to the user
  
The urban_dictionary.csv file is the database coming from Kaggle. It should be replaced with a new one soon!
